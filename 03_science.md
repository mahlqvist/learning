# The Science Behind Learning

We all have the tools to learn, even things that might not seem to come naturally to us, and the secret to learn anything is to understand how the brain works, so you can unlock its power. When solving a problem, it can be done using **focused thinking** or **diffuse thinking**. When your brain is in **focus mode**, you really concentrate on the matter at hand, it’s like having a one-track mind. Focused thinking is a **highly attentive state of mind** where the brain uses its best concentration abilities in the prefrontal cortex, to ignore all extraneous information.

When your brain is in **diffuse mode**, you let it wander freely, making connections at random. The diffuse mode of thinking does not happen in one area of the brain, but rather all over the place. In fact, that is the beauty of diffuse thinking, your brain has the **opportunity to connect the dots** and link neural processes.

While these two modes may seem to work in opposition to each other, **alternating between them** is the best way to **master a subject** or to solve a difficult problem. First, use the focused mode to **understand the basics**, then use the diffuse mode to **passively internalize what you've learned** and make connections to other things you already knew. Go back into focused mode and pare down the connections that's made to the best, most helpful things. Once you've repeated this process a few times, the information will really stick.

**Sleep** is crucial when it comes to learing, a state where the mind process and store information the brain has been fed during the day. Getting **plenty of deep, restful sleep** is essential for our physical and mental health, but a good night’s rest may also literally clear the mind. A [new study](https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2020/03/05/discovering-the-brains-nightly-rinse-cycle/) shows sleep triggers rhythmic waves of blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that appear to function much like a washing machine’s rinse cycle, which may help to clear the brain of toxic waste on a regular basis.

**Brain training** includes getting information and repetition (since it helps transition a skill from the conscious to the subconscious), as well as actual physical training. Thousands of new neurons are added into the adult hippocampus each day and one of the most effective ways to keep these cells from dying is by learning.

**Feedback** is an important part of learning, since it lets you know if you are on the right track or moving forward. A [recent study](https://hbr.org/2013/01/sometimes-negative-feedback-is) showed that experts or masters of their craft preferred negative feedback over positive. Probably because criticism is more actionable and it's easier to know what you're doing wrong or what people don't like. Positive feedback is great at the beginning when you might have self-doubt.

_"Early in the training process much of the feedback will come from the teacher or coach, who will monitor progress, point out problems, and offer ways to address those problems. With time and experience students must learn to monitor themselves, spot mistakes, and adjust accordingly. Such self-monitoring requires effective mental representations."_ - Anders Ericsson

**Procrastination** is actually about emotions, when you learn something new it activates an area of the brain associated with pain. To handle procrastination, there's no easy fix, you simly need to take the initiative and start doing the task. The pain you feel when you begin will actually make you feel better in the long term. People with anxiety, fear of failure or perfectionism are more likely to procrastinate, so by feeling happy and being in a good mode will help you overcome the procrastination.

Implement these 3 points in your daily anti-procrastination ritual:

1. Despite all the doubt, all the fear, all the negativity, just do it. Publish that post. Message that person. Read that book. Start that course. Without thinking of the results of your effort.

2. Start sloppy to avoid high expectations of your finished work. More pressure often equals more procrastination. If you don't have to make the greatest thing ever right from the start, it's much easier to start.

3. Start small, because you probably don't feel like writing a whole final thesis on a topic you barely know or running a marathon. But you might feel like writing a paragraph or two or feel like taking a short walk outside. Take small steps along the longer journey.

**Long term memory** is created by practice and repeat in order to strengthen the connection between neurons. A connection between two neurons becomes stronger when `neuron A` consistently activates `neuron B`, making it fire an action potential (spike), and the connection gets weaker if `neuron A` consistently fails to make `neuron B` fire a spike.

Long term memory is extremly important when it comes to learning because that's where you put the fundamental concepts and principles used when you learn something new. Short term memory usually involves our prefrontal cortex and can hold around four chunks of memory. To be able to move information from short term to long term done by using something called **spaced repetition**. Repeat something 20 times over 20 days, do small things repeatedly over time. connect with different concepts that we already have in our brain, like associate a famous person with a vacation, a resturant, a friend or anything related to that person. then practive and repeat over several days to add it into long term memory.

within 1 hour, if nothinig is done with the new information most people have forgotten about 50% of what they learned, after 24 hours this increases to 70%, and if a week passes up to 90% could be lost.
