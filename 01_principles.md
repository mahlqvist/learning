# The Principles

What's more important, **learning or winning the system**? Are you learning to get good grades or to actually improve and know the skills you are trying to learn? Long term learning is a much better bet than short term success, so don't care about what grade you get in a class, only care about what you learn in it.

In theory you shouldn't have to prepare for a knowledge test any more than you have to prepare for a blood test. The test should only measure how well you learned a certain subject. If you want anyone to invest their time and money in you, the best way is to actually **be a good investment**. Even if you could trick someone into investing in you, you'd be tricking yourself too, so instead of winning by hacking bad tests, **win by doing good work**!

The learning path you follow to get the career you want, is going to include **obstacles**, and those obstacles is what make most people quit. So how you encounter these obstacles, will **define your future success**. Shift your focus when you feel like you suck, and try to enjoy being bad for awhile, even the very best was a begginer at some point. In the end, it's all about drive, curiosity and progress.

Follow the **Pareto principle**, also referred to as the **80/20** rule, which states that for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. So focus on the vital courses, books or any learning media that will improve your learing and help you to stay on track.

Since there will always be someone better than you, focus on learning skills that work well together. Try to gather and combine skills in a certain way to create a niche for yourself, also known as **skill stacking**. This will make you stand out in a crowd, and even if you are among the top 20% in different individual skills, the combination of those skills could make you end up in the top 5% or even in the top 1%.

**Enjoy learning** and always hit targets inside yourself that make you happy. Negative people are in a disadvantage when it comes to learning, so find the key things that makes you happy.

1. Being with my family
2. Be confident in myself
3. Be healthy and vigorous
4. Contribute to something meaningful
5. Learning and developing skills

Even if you're passionate about something at first, when it becomes a must, it might not be as fun as it used to be. That's why it's more important to **build valuable skills**, than follow your passion. Passion can be developed, the more you know about a topic the more you will enjoy it. So learn to love the process of getting better and finally you get so good you can't be ignored.
