# Become an Efficient Learner

It's not about the extra hours, it's about **focusing on what really matters**, so the first and most important thing, should be what you actually learn. This is my summary of the udemy course [Learning to Learn [Efficient Learning]: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-to-learn-efficient-learning-zero-to-mastery/).

## The Principles

What's more important, **learning or winning**? Do you learn to get good grades or to actually improve and know the skills you are trying to learn? Testing yourself should only be about measuring how well you learned a certain subject, that way you **win by doing good work**. The best way to make anyone invest their time and money in you, is to actually **be a good investment**.

How well you **encounter obstacles** is going to define your future success. Shift your focus when you feel like you suck, and try to enjoy being bad for awhile, because even the very best started out as a begginer at some point. In the end, it's all about **drive**, **curiosity** and **progress**.

Gather and combine skills in a certain way to create a **unique skillstack** and niche for yourself. This will make you stand out in a crowd, even if you are not among the best in one specific skill. With the perfect mix of unique skills and values you could end up in the top 5% and make companies want to hire you on the spot.

Negative people are in a disadvantage when it comes to learning, so you should **enjoy learning** and always try to find the **key things that puts you in a good mood**, like being with your family, contribute to something meaningful or exercising.

## The Four Pillars of Learning

People with fixed mindset is making excuses to avoid challanges that could make them look dumb, and they will most likely give up as soon as they start struggling. Instead you should **develop a growth mindset**, which is the belief that intelligence can be developed. With a mind like that, **everyting is a game** and you improve constantly, exciting about every challange and obstacle standing in your way, just level up to overcome them.

**The Feynman Technique**, is a technique named after **Richard Feynman**, a Nobel Prize Winning Physicist, and it's designed to help you learn pretty much anything. It's about understand concepts you don't really get, remember stuff you have already learned.

1. Choose a concept you want to learn about
2. Pretend you are teaching it to a student in grade 6
3. Identify gaps in your explanation, go back to the source material, to better understand it
4. Review and simplify (optional)

Make sure to understand the **fundemantal principals** before you go into details, because knowledge is constantly being updated but the fundametals could last throughout a career. So start with the basics, from the roots and know your "why" before you dig deeper into a subject and work yourself uy.

**Efficiency** is about being smart with your time, about using the right strategies and methods to learn the right topics. It's not about putting in the extra hours, or work the hardest, it's about **focusing on what really matters**.

## The Science Behind Learning

The secret to learn anything is to **understand how the brain works**, so you can unlock its power. When learning a subject or solving a problem, you can use **focused thinking** or **diffuse thinking**.

When your brain is in **focus mode**, it uses its best concentration abilities in the prefrontal cortex, and it’s like having a one-track mind. When your brain is in **diffuse mode**, you let it wander freely, making connections at random. The diffuse mode of thinking does happens all over the brain, and that's the beauty of diffuse thinking, your brain has the opportunity to **connect the dots** and **link neural processes**.

While these two modes may seem to work in opposition to each other, **alternating between them** is the best way to **master a subject** or to solve a difficult problem. First, use the focused mode to **understand the basics**, then use the diffuse mode to **passively internalize what you've learned** and make connections to other things you already knew.

Getting **plenty of deep, restful sleep** is essential for our physical and mental health, and is crucial when it comes to learing, because it's a state where the mind process and store information the brain has been fed during the day.

**Physical exercise** is also important as it reduce insulin resistance, reduce inflammation, and stimulate the release of growth factor chemicals in the brain, that affect the health of brain cells. It also improve the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and even the abundance and survival of new brain cells. Thousands of new **neurons are added into the adult hippocampus each day**, and one of the most effective ways to keep these cells from dying, is by learning.

A connection between two neurons becomes stronger when `neuron A` consistently activates `neuron B`, making it fire an action potential (spike), and the connection gets weaker if `neuron A` consistently fails to make `neuron B` fire a spike. **Long-term memory** is extremly important when it comes to knowledge because that's where you put the **fundamental concepts and principles** used to pare new iformation with.

**Short-term memory** usually involves our prefrontal cortex and can hold around **four chunks of memory**, and moving information from short-term memory to long-term memeory is done by using something called **spaced repetition**. The problem with short-term memory is that the brain has **strict limits** on how many items it can hold, something long-term memory doesn’t have.

If nothinig is done with the new information within **1 hour**, most people have **forgotten about 50%** of what they learned, after 24 hours this increases to 70%, and if a week passes up to 90% could be lost.

**Spaced repetion** means going back and repeat what you've learnig over a long period of time, not going through everything or re-reading everything, just the important parts or concepts. You should have **gaps of increasing length**, because each time you do a recall at the sweet spot of forgetting, the memory’s decay slows down.

Listening to podcast or watching videos is **passive learning**, but in order to form connections between neurons you need to take action. **Active learning** is when you get involved, practicing, taking notes and solve problems. Retrieving knowledge from your long time memroy actually improves your ability to retrieve knowledge in the future.

When learning anything, you eventually reach a point where you start to plateau, and don't get that immediate progress you saw in the past. Beginners get frustrated at this stage as they don't see themselves improving. This is where **deliberate practice** comes in, which include **setting specific goals**, **using intense focus** and **get immediate feedback**. This requires getting out of your comfort zone, and it probably won't be much fun, since its hard work and you feel you are not good enough.

Your goals should be small enough to be **manageable**, but specific and **well defined**, so you know what you want to hit. A goal without a plan is just a wish, a goal should follow the **S.M.A.R.T.** method:

- **S**pecific, your goal must be clear and well defined
- **M**easureable, set smaller milestone you can aim for
- **A**ttainable, make sure it's possible and achievable
- **R**elevant, "why" do you set this goal, is it relevant to your lifeplan
- **T**ime bound, you must have a deadline

**Procrastination** is actually about emotions, when you learn something new it activates an area of the brain associated with pain or negative feelings. To handle procrastination, there's no easy fix, you simly need to take the initiative and start doing the task. Three things that might help you:

1. **Just do it!** Despite all the doubt, all the fear, all the negativity, just do it. Read that book. Start that course. Without thinking of the results of your effort.

2. **Start sloppy!** This avoid high expectations of your finished work. More pressure often equals more procrastination.

3. **Start small!** You probably don't feel like writing a whole book or running a marathon. But you might feel like writing a paragraph or two or taking a short walk outside.

## The Techniques

Find the technique that works best for you and use your understanding of how the brain learn new things, to take advantage of the learning technique of your choice.

**The Pomodoro technique** is about going back and forth between focus mode and diffuse mode, go into **focus mode** for 25 minutes, followed by 5 minutes of **diffuse thinking**. This technique is proven to be one of the best ways to tackle procrastination. It doesn't have to be 25 minutes, pick something that works for you.

Break down the subject you are trying to learn into small pieces, then use **spaced repetition** on those pieces, meaning you go back and repeat what you've learned in order to store them in your long-term memory.

Just like spaced repetition, **deliberate practice** is tried and well-known, so its something you have to do if you want to be an efficient learner. Set **specific goals**, go into **focus mode** using the pomodoro technique and try getting **immediate feedback**.

Create good **habits** using the four laws of behaviour change:

1. It has to be obvious, what is the exact thing you want to accomplish.
2. It has to be easy to form a new habit.
3. It has to be attractive, the outcome must lead to a better place.
4. It has to be satisfying, the new habit must be rewarding. 

You need to do it over and over for it to stick, so using a habit tracker app or similar is a good choice. Try **not to break the chain**!

When learning something, **evoke as many senses** as possible, since humans are incredibly good at remembering visual things. By using storytelling you will make it more memorable than just reading simple facts. The more your story evoke emotions and senses the better, and a great technique for creating such stories is the **method of loci** or the **memory palace technique**.

Focus on the **concepts**, which are high level topics that give you context of what you learn of the world around you. The **concepts** are valuable, while **facts** are cheap, because anybody can learn facts, it doesn't require any special power to retain facts.

Never stop ask yourself why, use the **Feynman technique**, and you need to actually practice, you can't just passively watch somebody else do it. Test youself on what you just learned, even if its uncomfortable, but pause and think about what the key ideas were, and summarize. If you get something wrong, find out why, really understand what you did wrong in order to fix that problem, that way you **learn from your mistakes**.

Pick a topic and decide what you are going to do the **first 20 hours** to get as far as possible on your journey towards mastery!

1. Create a roadmap for the 20 hours.
2. Use active learning, create practice drills and test yourself every hour or so.
3. Create a good feedback system, so you know you hit your goals.
4. Start with the most critical skill, use the Pareto principle, the 20% that will give you 80%. 
5. Use the Pomodora technique and spaced repetition for the actual learning.
6. Avoid procrastination, make it easy and fun to continue.
